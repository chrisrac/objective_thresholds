This module uses Fisher-Jenks natural breakpoint analysis for identifying 
objective breakpoint threshold of low flows.

This method is further described in:
Raczynski K., Dyer J., 2022, Development of an Objective Low Flow Identification
Method Using Breakpoint Analysis, XXX(X), XXX-XXX. doi:XXX-XXX-XX-XX-X

Future functionalities will be added in later development.
